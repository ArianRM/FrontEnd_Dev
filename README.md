<h1>ROAD TO FRONTEND</h1>

<p>This was the projects that I develop in the path to become a Software Developer</p>

<h2>My learning path was as follows</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>HTML and CSS:</strong> It was easy in a way, I learned about all the semantics tags and the correct use of them. I learned about styles, pseudo-classes and some animations. I implemented BEM methodologies in the naming of the classes and id's of the tags
  </li>
  
</ol>
